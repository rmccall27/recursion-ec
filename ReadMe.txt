******* I did not create Turtle.java or World.java *******

I used existing code (Turtle.java and World.java) to create a recursive pattern
called a Sierpinski Carpet. The main method calls the SierpinskiCarpet method and
has three parameters; a turtle object, the number of levels, and the length of
one side of the center square. The levels parameter tells the program how deep
to make the Sierpinski Carpet. Each level is defined recursively in terms of 
the level before it.
